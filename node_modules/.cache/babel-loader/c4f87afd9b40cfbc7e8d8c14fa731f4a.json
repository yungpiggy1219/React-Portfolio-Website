We gave out surveys to ask users about how reliable the information provided and whether or not they will read the contents. We received mixed responses but the majority felt they would just go to a more reliable source for the information. So we decided to remove the copied articles and reduce it to only simple information about cancer.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <div>\r\n                    <Button href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XT6Os7P-ZAPj8kuaLxOPbeL2NUTpK-KyveWlfuHOngg/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" variant=\"outline\" className=\"custom-btn\">Full Report</Button>\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n                <div className='myFooter'>\r\n                    <div className='hoverUnderline backDiv'>\r\n                        <Nav.Link as={NavLink} to=\"/work\"><Icon style={{ fontSize: '36px' }} icon=\"bx:arrow-back\" /> Back</Nav.Link>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <h5>\r\n                        © 2022 yung chu chuang\r\n                    </h5>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </Row>\r\n        </Container >\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n"],"mappings":"AAAA,OAASA,SAAT,CAAoBC,GAApB,CAAyBC,GAAzB,CAA8BC,WAA9B,KAAiD,iBAAjD,CAEA,MAAOC,IAAP,KAAgB,qBAAhB,CACA,OAASC,aAAa,GAAIC,OAA1B,CAAkCC,MAAlC,CAA0CC,KAA1C,CAAiDC,OAAjD,KAAgE,kBAAhE,CACA,MAAOC,OAAP,KAAmB,wBAAnB,CACA,MAAOC,SAAP,KAAqB,0BAArB,CAEA,OAASC,IAAT,KAAqB,gBAArB,CAEA,MAAOC,SAAP,KAAqB,8BAArB,CACA,MAAOC,cAAP,KAA0B,6BAA1B,CACA,MAAOC,SAAP,KAAqB,wBAArB,CACA,MAAOC,UAAP,KAAsB,4BAAtB,CACA,MAAOC,WAAP,KAAuB,8BAAvB,CACA,MAAOC,UAAP,KAAsB,qBAAtB,CACA,MAAOC,UAAP,KAAsB,qBAAtB,CACA,MAAOC,UAAP,KAAsB,qBAAtB,CACA,MAAOC,UAAP,KAAsB,qBAAtB,CACA,MAAOC,UAAP,KAAsB,qBAAtB,C,wFAEA,cAAe,SAASC,SAAT,EAAoB,CAC/B,mBACI,KAAC,SAAD,EAAW,SAAS,CAAC,WAArB,uBACI,MAAC,GAAD,yBACI,YAAK,SAAS,CAAC,wBAAf,uBACI,MAAC,GAAD,CAAK,IAAL,EAAU,SAAS,CAAC,GAApB,CAAwB,EAAE,CAAEd,OAA5B,CAAqC,EAAE,CAAC,OAAxC,wBAAgD,KAAC,IAAD,EAAM,KAAK,CAAE,CAAEe,QAAQ,CAAE,MAAZ,CAAb,CAAmC,IAAI,CAAC,eAAxC,EAAhD,WADJ,EADJ,cAII,YAAK,GAAG,CAAEX,QAAV,CAAoB,GAAG,CAAC,uBAAxB,EAJJ,cAKI,WAAI,SAAS,CAAC,MAAd,wBALJ,cAMI,WAAI,SAAS,CAAC,MAAd,yBANJ,cAOI,8NAPJ,cAUI,gCAVJ,cAaI,2VAbJ,cAgBI,+BAhBJ,cAmBI,MAAC,GAAD,yBACI,MAAC,GAAD,yBACI,+BADJ,cAII,YAAK,KAAK,CAAC,YAAX,uBACI,YAAK,GAAG,CAAEE,QAAV,CAAoB,GAAG,CAAC,aAAxB,EADJ,EAJJ,GADJ,cASI,MAAC,GAAD,yBACI,6CADJ,cAII,YAAK,KAAK,CAAC,YAAX,uBACI,YAAK,GAAG,CAAED,aAAV,CAAyB,GAAG,CAAC,aAA7B,EADJ,EAJJ,GATJ,GAnBJ,cAqCI,oCArCJ,cAwCI,4CAxCJ,cA2CI,yJACwH,uCADxH,sCACoK,kCADpK,2RA3CJ,cA8CI,4DAC2B,oDAD3B,8TA9CJ,cAiDI,kHACiF,sCADjF,wYAjDJ,cAqDI,qCArDJ,cAwDI,KAAC,GAAD,wBACI,YAAK,KAAK,CAAC,YAAX,uBACI,YAAK,GAAG,CAAEG,UAAV,CAAsB,GAAG,CAAC,aAA1B,EADJ,EADJ,EAxDJ,cA6DI,KAAC,GAAD,wBACI,oDACmB,yCADnB,22BADJ,EA7DJ,cAkEI,0CAlEJ,cAqEI,KAAC,GAAD,wBACI,YAAK,KAAK,CAAC,YAAX,uBACI,YAAK,GAAG,CAAED,SAAV,CAAqB,GAAG,CAAC,aAAzB,EADJ,EADJ,EArEJ,cA0EI,MAAC,GAAD,yBACI,uJACsH,4CADtH,qTADJ,cAKI,sQALJ,GA1EJ,cAmFI,2CAnFJ,cAsFI,MAAC,QAAD,EAAU,OAAO,CAAC,MAAlB,wBACI,KAAC,QAAD,CAAU,IAAV,wBACI,YACI,SAAS,CAAC,yBADd,CAEI,GAAG,CAAEE,SAFT,EADJ,EADJ,cAOI,KAAC,QAAD,CAAU,IAAV,wBACI,YACI,SAAS,CAAC,yBADd,CAEI,GAAG,CAAEC,SAFT,EADJ,EAPJ,cAaI,KAAC,QAAD,CAAU,IAAV,wBACI,YACI,SAAS,CAAC,yBADd,CAEI,GAAG,CAAEC,SAFT,EADJ,EAbJ,cAmBI,KAAC,QAAD,CAAU,IAAV,wBACI,YACI,SAAS,CAAC,yBADd,CAEI,GAAG,CAAEC,SAFT,EADJ,EAnBJ,cAyBI,KAAC,QAAD,CAAU,IAAV,wBACI,YACI,SAAS,CAAC,yBADd,CAEI,GAAG,CAAEC,SAFT,EADJ,EAzBJ,GAtFJ,cAsHI,sCAtHJ,cA0HI,iZA1HJ,cA6HI,kCACI,mCACI,iDADJ,cAII,4CAJJ,GADJ,EA7HJ,cAuII,8rBAvIJ,cA2II,kCACI,KAAC,MAAD,EAAQ,IAAI,CAAC,kGAAb,CAAgH,MAAM,CAAC,QAAvH,CAAgI,OAAO,CAAC,SAAxI,CAAkJ,SAAS,CAAC,YAA5J,yBADJ,EA3IJ,cA+II,aAAK,SAAS,CAAC,UAAf,wBACI,YAAK,SAAS,CAAC,wBAAf,uBACI,MAAC,GAAD,CAAK,IAAL,EAAU,EAAE,CAAEb,OAAd,CAAuB,EAAE,CAAC,OAA1B,wBAAkC,KAAC,IAAD,EAAM,KAAK,CAAE,CAAEe,QAAQ,CAAE,MAAZ,CAAb,CAAmC,IAAI,CAAC,eAAxC,EAAlC,WADJ,EADJ,cAII,iDAJJ,GA/IJ,GADJ,EADJ,CA4JH"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
