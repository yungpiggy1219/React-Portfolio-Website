We\n          gave out surveys to ask users about how reliable the information\n          provided and whether or not they will read the contents. We received\n          mixed responses but the majority felt they would just go to a more\n          reliable source for the information. So we decided to remove the\n          copied articles and reduce it to only simple information about cancer.\n        </p>\n\n        <div>\n          <Button\n            href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XT6Os7P-ZAPj8kuaLxOPbeL2NUTpK-KyveWlfuHOngg/edit?usp=sharing\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            variant=\"outline\"\n            className=\"custom-btn\"\n          >\n            Full Report\n          </Button>\n        </div>\n        <Row>\n          <div className=\"hoverUnderline backDiv\">\n            <Nav.Link as={NavLink} to=\"/work\">\n              <Icon style={{ fontSize: \"36px\" }} icon=\"bx:left-arrow-alt\" />{\" \"}\n              Back\n            </Nav.Link>\n          </div>\n        </Row>\n        <Footer />\n      </Row>\n    </Container>\n  );\n}\n */"],"mappings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},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
