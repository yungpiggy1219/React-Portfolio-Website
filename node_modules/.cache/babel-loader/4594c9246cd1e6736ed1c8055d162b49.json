I created the UI mock-up and prototypes, assisted the Android engineer with some layout, functions, animations, analytic code insertions, and debugging, wrote the copy for the play store, communicated with multiple translators, created tutorial images, and lastly created the promo video using Adobe After Effects and iMovie.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                <h5>\r\n                    Google Play Video\r\n                </h5>\r\n                <div class=\"ratio ratio-16x9\">\r\n\r\n                    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dFrU06P7xPo\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div className='myFooter'>\r\n                    <div className='hoverUnderline backDiv'>\r\n                        <Nav.Link as={NavLink} to=\"/work\"><Icon style={{ fontSize: '36px' }} icon=\"bx:arrow-back\" /> Back</Nav.Link>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <h5>\r\n                        © 2022 yung chu chuang\r\n                    </h5>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </Row>\r\n        </Container >\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n"],"mappings":";AAAA,SAASA,SAAT,EAAoBC,GAApB,EAAyBC,GAAzB,EAA8BC,WAA9B,QAAiD,iBAAjD;AAEA,OAAOC,GAAP,MAAgB,qBAAhB;AACA,SAASC,aAAa,IAAIC,MAA1B,EAAkCC,MAAlC,EAA0CC,KAA1C,EAAiDC,OAAjD,QAAgE,kBAAhE;AAEA,SAASC,IAAT,QAAqB,gBAArB;AAEA,OAAOC,KAAP,MAAkB,2BAAlB;AACA,OAAOC,MAAP,MAAmB,sBAAnB;AACA,OAAOC,MAAP,MAAmB,sBAAnB;AACA,OAAOC,MAAP,MAAmB,sBAAnB;;AAEA,eAAe,SAASC,SAAT,GAAqB;EAChC,oBACI,QAAC,SAAD;IAAW,SAAS,EAAC,WAArB;IAAA,uBACI,QAAC,GAAD;MAAA,wBACI;QAAK,SAAS,EAAC,wBAAf;QAAA,uBACI,QAAC,GAAD,CAAK,IAAL;UAAU,SAAS,EAAC,GAApB;UAAwB,EAAE,EAAEN,OAA5B;UAAqC,EAAE,EAAC,OAAxC;UAAA,wBAAgD,QAAC,IAAD;YAAM,KAAK,EAAE;cAAEO,QAAQ,EAAE;YAAZ,CAAb;YAAmC,IAAI,EAAC;UAAxC;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAhD;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA;MADJ;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QADJ,eAII;QAAK,GAAG,EAAEL,KAAV;QAAiB,GAAG,EAAC;MAArB;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAJJ,eAKI;QAAI,SAAS,EAAC,MAAd;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QALJ,eAMI;QAAI,SAAS,EAAC,MAAd;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QANJ,eAOI;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAPJ,eAWI;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAXJ,eAcI;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAdJ,eAkBI;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAlBJ,eAsBI;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAtBJ,eAyBI,QAAC,GAAD;QAAA,wBACI,QAAC,GAAD;UAAA,uBACI;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA;QADJ;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QADJ,eAMI,QAAC,GAAD;UAAA,uBACI;YAAK,KAAK,EAAC,cAAX;YAAA,uBACI;cAAK,GAAG,EAAEC,MAAV;cAAkB,GAAG,EAAC;YAAtB;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA;UADJ;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA;QADJ;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QANJ;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAzBJ,eAuCI;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAvCJ,eA0CI;QAAK,KAAK,EAAC,cAAX;QAAA,uBACI;UAAK,GAAG,EAAEA,MAAV;UAAkB,GAAG,EAAC;QAAtB;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA;MADJ;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QA1CJ,eA6CI;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QA7CJ,eAgDI,QAAC,GAAD;QAAA,wBAEI,QAAC,GAAD;UAAA,uBACI;YAAK,KAAK,EAAC,cAAX;YAAA,uBACI;cAAK,GAAG,EAAEA,MAAV;cAAkB,GAAG,EAAC;YAAtB;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA;UADJ;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA;QADJ;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAFJ,eASI,QAAC,GAAD;UAAA,uBACI;YAAK,KAAK,EAAC,cAAX;YAAA,uBACI;cAAK,GAAG,EAAEA,MAAV;cAAkB,GAAG,EAAC;YAAtB;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA;UADJ;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA;QADJ;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QATJ;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAhDJ,eAwEI,QAAC,GAAD;QAAK,SAAS,EAAC,UAAf;QAAA,uBACI;UAAK,KAAK,EAAC,SAAX;UAAA,wBACI;YAAK,KAAK,EAAC,cAAX;YAAA,uBACI;cAAK,GAAG,EAAEA,MAAV;cAAkB,GAAG,EAAC;YAAtB;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA;UADJ;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QADJ,eAII;YAAK,KAAK,EAAC,cAAX;YAAA,uBACI;cAAK,GAAG,EAAEC,MAAV;cAAkB,GAAG,EAAC;YAAtB;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA;UADJ;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAJJ,eAOI;YAAK,KAAK,EAAC,cAAX;YAAA,uBACI;cAAK,GAAG,EAAEC,MAAV;cAAkB,GAAG,EAAC;YAAtB;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA;UADJ;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAPJ;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA;MADJ;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAxEJ,eAqFI;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QArFJ,eAyFI;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAzFJ,eA8FI;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QA9FJ,eAiGI;QAAK,KAAK,EAAC,kBAAX;QAAA,uBAEI;UAAQ,KAAK,EAAC,KAAd;UAAoB,MAAM,EAAC,KAA3B;UAAiC,GAAG,EAAC,2CAArC;UAAiF,KAAK,EAAC,sBAAvF;UAA8G,WAAW,EAAC,GAA1H;UAA8H,KAAK,EAAC,0FAApI;UAA+N,eAAe;QAA9O;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA;MAFJ;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAjGJ,eAqGI;QAAK,SAAS,EAAC,UAAf;QAAA,wBACI;UAAK,SAAS,EAAC,wBAAf;UAAA,uBACI,QAAC,GAAD,CAAK,IAAL;YAAU,EAAE,EAAEL,OAAd;YAAuB,EAAE,EAAC,OAA1B;YAAA,wBAAkC,QAAC,IAAD;cAAM,KAAK,EAAE;gBAAEO,QAAQ,EAAE;cAAZ,CAAb;cAAmC,IAAI,EAAC;YAAxC;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAAlC;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA;QADJ;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QADJ,eAII;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAJJ;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QArGJ;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EADJ;IAAA;IAAA;IAAA;EAAA,QADJ;AAkHH;KAnHuBD,S"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
