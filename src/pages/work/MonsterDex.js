          This app is for education purpose only. My friend is building his
          portfolio in mobile development and wanted something nice and
          presentable. He decided to make an Pokédex app. In Apple App Store,
          the current available app are either <b>outdated</b>, <b>buggy</b> or{" "}
          <b>lack of aesthetics</b>. To develop a better product, we studied the
          competitors and learn what users want out of the app.
        </p>
        <p>From the competitors, we can categorize the users into 2 types:</p>

        <h5>Lessons Learned​</h5>
        <p>
          Throughout the process of creating an <b>iOS app</b> with my team of
          two, where I took charge of the <b>UX/UI design</b> using <b>Figma</b>
          , I have learned valuable lessons that have shaped my understanding
          and approach to app development. One of the most significant lessons I
          have learned is the importance of collaboration and effective
          communication within a small team. Working closely with my partner
          allowed us to leverage our individual strengths and combine our
          creative visions to create a cohesive and <b>user-friendly app</b>. I
          realized that open and transparent <b>communication</b> is key to
          successfully aligning our ideas and ensuring that the app’s design met
          the desired objectives. Additionally, this experience taught me the
          importance of user-centered design principles. By conducting{" "}
          <b>user research</b>, creating <b>wireframes</b>, and{" "}
          <b>prototyping</b>, I was able to iterate and refine the design based
          on user feedback, ultimately leading to an improved user experience.
          Lastly, I learned the value of <b>attention to detail</b> and
          <b>consistency in design</b>. Through meticulous refinement and
          adhering to design guidelines, I ensured that the app’s visual
          elements and interactions were consistent and intuitive, contributing
          to a seamless and delightful user experience. Overall, this project
          has enriched my understanding of <b>teamwork</b>,{" "}
          <b>user-centered design</b>, and the significance of consistent
          attention to detail in app development, leaving me better equipped for
          future design endeavors.
