        <h5>Discover</h5>
        <p>
          To begin, I conducted extensive research to understand Likee's user
          base, their needs and preferences, and the competitive landscape. This
          research involved market research and competitive analysis. I used app
          analytic tools like App Annie to analyze user behavior and identify
          opportunities for growth. From this research, I gained valuable
          insights into user behavior and preferences, which informed the design
          of the app.

        <h5>Ideation</h5>
        <p>
          Using the insights gathered from my research, I began the ideation
          phase, which involved brainstorming ideas and creating initial
          wireframes and user flows. I used Figma to create wireframes, which
          allowed me to quickly iterate and refine my designs based on user
          feedback.
        </p>
        <h5>Prototyping</h5>
        <p>
          Once I had a solid understanding of the user needs and the app's
          functionality, I created prototypes that allowed me to test and refine
          the design. I worked closely with the Android engineer to ensure that
          the layout and functions were seamless, and I provided responsive
          testing to ensure that the app worked smoothly on a range of devices.

        <h5>Lessons Learned</h5>
        <p>
          Throughout this project, I learned the importance of being adaptable
          and willing to take on a range of tasks. As someone with no previous
          experience in UI design, I quickly became proficient in Figma and was
          able to create a polished and professional UI for Likee XDownloader. I
          also developed my skills in developer assistance, marketing research,
          and visual content creation, making me a versatile and valuable member
          of any design team.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am passionate about UI/UX design and believe that my experience with
          Likee XDownloader demonstrates my ability to follow a design thought
          process and create innovative and user-friendly designs. I am excited
          to bring my skills and enthusiasm to a new role and to continue
          learning and growing as a designer.
