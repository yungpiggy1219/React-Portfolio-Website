                    This is a board game I’m creating on my own. This game is the first game I’ve created and hosted playtesting sessions. Most of my other ideas involve many tokens or meeples, which would have budget issues when manufacturing. I originally designed this game with some constraint, where it will only include cards. The first prototype is made with hand-drawn cards. Later I made a printed prototype with my own printers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wanted this game to be educational where players can learn the basics of boolean algebra. To make this game more accessible around the world, I minimized the use of texts especially on individual cards. I’ve tested the game with players from the age of 8 years old to 50 years old. An 8 year-old might not necessarily fully understand how and why boolean algebra works, they can still understand the big picture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’ve launched this project on Kickstarter once. My goal was set to $4096 and I raised $754 by the end of the campaign. It wasn’t too bad because I did not put up ads. I had 4 backers who backed the digital print-and-play version and 46 backers who backed the physical version. This was a great experience and there is room for improvement.

                    To make the game more accessible in different languages, all the cards has an unique icon. Most texts in the cards are “computer language” which were usually not translated.

                    There are 16 “task cards.” Each task card is a “number” in binary. In the background of the card, there are also English and hexadecimal.

                    The card back is inspired by a PCB board.
